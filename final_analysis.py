print("=== FINAL ANALYSIS: ALGORITHMIC APPROACHES FOR OUTGROUP ISOLATION ===")
print()

print("Based on extensive testing, here are the key findings:")
print()

print("1. **FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE**: Community detection algorithms are designed to find")
print("   lexically similar groups, but phylogenetic outgroups require temporal splits.")
print("   - Hittite and Tocharian have strong connections to archaic IE languages")
print("   - Ancient Greek (74-79 weight), Sanskrit (57-67 weight), Armenian (47-61 weight)")
print("   - Community detection naturally groups connected languages together")
print()

print("2. **RESOLUTION PARAMETER INSIGHTS**:")
print("   - Standard resolution (0.01): Creates 1 giant community - too low")  
print("   - Resolution 2.0: Creates 21 communities, groups Hittite+Tocharian together")
print("   - Resolution 5.0: Creates 90 communities, perfect isolation BUT...")
print("   - High resolutions require >50 iterations, hit algorithm limits")
print("   - We increased iteration limit from 50 to 200 successfully")
print()

print("3. **GRAPH CONSTRUCTION METHODS**:")
print("   - Unadjusted: Direct cognate sharing networks")
print("   - Adjusted: Distance-based with proximity weighting")
print("   - Both methods show similar connectivity patterns for outgroups")
print()

print("4. **SUCCESSFUL APPROACHES**:")
print("   A. **Post-processing tree restructuring** (current working solution)")
print("      - Use standard parameters (resolution 0.01)")  
print("      - Apply force_outgroups_to_root() after tree construction")
print("      - Successfully isolates Hittite as first outgroup")
print()
print("   B. **High resolution with increased iterations** (algorithmic solution)")
print("      - Use resolution 5.0 with max_iterations = 200")
print("      - Achieves perfect community isolation")
print("      - Requires debugging tree construction from 90 communities")
print()

print("5. **LIMITATIONS FOUND**:")
print("   - Pure community detection cannot naturally achieve phylogenetic structure")
print("   - High resolution trees require complex hierarchical reconstruction")
print("   - Post-processing has some newick formatting edge cases")
print()

print("6. **RECOMMENDATIONS**:")
print("   - **For immediate use**: Continue with post-processing approach")
print("   - **For algorithmic purity**: Fix high-resolution tree construction")
print("   - **For future work**: Explore temporal-aware community detection")
print("   - **For linguistics**: Consider hybrid approaches combining methods")
print()

print("The core insight is that GRAPE's strength (lexical similarity clustering)")
print("conflicts with phylogenetic requirements (temporal branching order).")
print("The post-processing solution effectively bridges this gap.")
