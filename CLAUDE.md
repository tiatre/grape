## Architecture

### Core Components

- **grape.py**: Main module containing community detection methods, parameter search strategies, and tree construction logic
- **common.py**: Shared data structures (HistoryEntry) and utility functions for reading cognate files  
- **distance_tree.py**: Alternative phylogenetic methods using distance matrices (NJ/UPGMA) with BioPython

### Key Classes

- `CommunityMethod` (abstract): Base class for community detection algorithms
  - `GreedyModularity`: Uses NetworkX greedy modularity maximization
  - `LouvainCommunities`: Uses NetworkX Louvain algorithm
- `ParameterSearchStrategy` (abstract): Base class for parameter optimization
  - `FixedParameterStrategy`: Uses fixed resolution value
  - `DynamicParameterStrategy`: Adjusts parameters based on community count
  - `AdaptiveDynamicAdjustmentStrategy`: Adaptive parameter adjustment

### Data Flow

1. Read cognate data from TSV files using `common.read_cognate_file()`
2. Build NetworkX graph with linguistic distance weights
3. Apply community detection at different resolution parameters
4. Convert community structure to phylogenetic tree using ETE3
5. Output final tree in Newick format

## Common Commands

### Running GRAPE Analysis

```bash
# Basic usage with sample data
python grape.py data/iecor_small.tsv

# With specific parameters
python grape.py data/iecor_small.tsv --graph adjusted --community louvain --strategy fixed --initial_value 0.5

# Advanced options
python grape.py data/dataset.tsv --graph adjusted --community greedy --strategy adaptive --proximity_weight 0.8 --sharing_factor 0.3
```

### Command Line Options

- `--graph {adjusted,unadjusted}`: Graph construction method
- `--community {greedy,louvain}`: Community detection algorithm  
- `--strategy {fixed,dynamic,adaptive}`: Parameter search strategy
- `--synonyms {average,min,max}`: Synonym handling for adjusted weights
- `--missing_data {max_dist,zero,ignore}`: Missing data strategy

### Testing with Sample Data

The `data/` directory contains several cognate datasets:
- `iecor_small.tsv`: Small Indo-European dataset (recommended for testing)
- `iecor_full.tsv`: Full Indo-European dataset
- `dravlex.tsv`: Dravidian languages
- `tuled.tsv`: Tupian languages

## Development Notes

### Dependencies

Core dependencies from requirements.txt:
- `ete3`: Tree manipulation and visualization
- `networkx`: Graph algorithms and community detection
- `numpy`: Numerical computations
- `six`: Python 2/3 compatibility (required by ete3)

Additional dependency for distance-based methods:

### Output Format

GRAPE outputs phylogenetic trees in Newick format to standard output.

### Testing

Run the test suite with:

```bash
# Basic tests for original datasets
python test_grape.py -v
